# How to Do Philosophy

In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college. 
I had several motives, some more honorable than others. One of the less honorable was to shock people. 
College was regarded as job training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do. 
Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.

## Words

I did end up being a philosophy major for most of college. 
It didn't work out as I'd hoped. I didn't learn any magical truths compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge. 
But I do at least know now why I didn't. 
Philosophy doesn't really have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other university subjects do. 
There is no core of knowledge one must master. 
The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various individual philosophers have said about different topics over the years. 
Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered.

### Formal Logic

Formal logic has some subject matter. 
I took several classes in logic. 
I don't know if I learned anything from them. 
It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in one's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a couple things changed. 
But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it? 
I don't know.

### A Useful Lesson

The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard. 
Even a concept as dear to us as *I*. 
It took me a while to grasp this, but when I did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been told as a child was all wrong. 
Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings. 
Everyday words are inherently imprecise. 
They work well enough in everyday life that you don't notice. 
Words seem to work, just as Newtonian physics seems to. 
But you can always make them break if you push them far enough.

## History

Western philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. 
What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis. 
Presumably they were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent cosmologies.

### The Early Days

With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition turned a corner. 
There started to be a lot more analysis. 
I suspect Plato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math. 
Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories about them. 

People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize what a leap it must have been when they first started to. 
It was presumably many thousands of years between when people first started describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked "what is heat?" 
No doubt it was a very gradual process. 
We don't know if Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they did. 
But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them, at least.

## Theoretical Knowledge

Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory in one lifetime. 
If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of thinking was. 

This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive and yet naive and mistaken. 
It was impressive even to ask the questions they did. 
That doesn't mean they always came up with good answers. 
It's not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have made their lives easier. 
So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers were similarly naive. 
In particular, they don't seem to have fully grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that words break if you push them too far.

## The Singularity

The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is how little effect they have. 
No one after reading Aristotle's *Metaphysics* does anything differently as a result. 
Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications to be interesting? 
No, they may not have to. 
Hardy's boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it. 
But he turned out to be mistaken. 
In fact, it's suspiciously hard to find a field of math that truly has no practical use. 
And Aristotle's explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the *Metaphysics* implies that philosophy should be useful too.

## A Proposal

We may be able to do better. 
Here's an intriguing possibility. 
Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what he did. 
The goal he announces in the *Metaphysics* seems one worth pursuing: to discover the most general truths. 
That sounds good. 
But instead of trying to discover them because they're useless, let's try to discover them because they're useful.

### A New Approach

I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering off into a swamp of abstractions. 
Instead of trying to answer the question: 
> What are the most general truths?

let's try to answer the question
> Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?

The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read what we've written to do anything differently afterward. 
Knowing we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from straying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.

## Notes

[1]
In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite some progress in the last150 years we're still only able to formalize a small percentage of statements. 
We may never do that much better, for the same reason1980s-style "knowledge representation" could never have worked; many statements may have no representation more concise than a huge, analog brain state.

[2]
It was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than we can easily imagine. 
The story of creation in the Bible is not just a Judeo-Christian concept; it's roughly what everyone must have believed since before people were people. 
The hard part of grasping evolution was to realize that species weren't, as they seem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different, simpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.

Now we don't have to make that leap. 
No one in an industrialized country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an adult. 
Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or heresy.

[3]
Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse. 
This must have affected what they said. 
If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation. 
Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.

[4]
Philosophy is like math's ne'er-do-well brother. 
It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked at the works of their predecessors and said in effect "why can't you be more like your brother?"

Russell was still saying the same thing2300 years later.

Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy the imprecise half. 
It's probably inevitable that philosophy will suffer by comparison, because there's no lower bound to its precision. 
Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense. 
And yet there are *some* good ideas in the imprecise half.

[5]
Aristotle's best work was in logic and zoology, both of which he can be said to have invented. 
But the most dramatic departure from his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of thinking. 
He was arguably the first scientist.

Some would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize, because his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture. 
Certainly a lot of the words we use have a connection with Aristotle, but it seems a bit much to suggest that we wouldn't have the concept of the essence of something or the distinction between matter and form if Aristotle hadn't written about them.

One way to see how much we really depend on Aristotle would be to diff European culture with Chinese: what ideas did European culture have in1800 that Chinese culture didn't, in virtue of Aristotle's contribution?

[8]
The meaning of the word "philosophy" has changed over time. 
In ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in scope to our "scholarship" (though without the methodological implications). 
Even as late as Newton's time it included what we now call "science." 
But core of the subject today is still what seemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most general truths.

Aristotle didn't call this "metaphysics." 
That name got assigned to it because the books we now call the *Metaphysics* came after (meta = after) the *Physics* in the standard edition of Aristotle's works compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later. 
What we call "metaphysics" Aristotle called "first philosophy."

Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.

Abstract-sounding nonsense seems to be most attractive when it's aligned with some axe the audience already has to grind. 
If this is so we should find it's most popular with groups that are (or feel) weak. 
The powerful don't need its reassurance.

A preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle and1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I. Kant.

Wittgenstein asserted a sort of mastery to which the inhabitants of early20th century Cambridge seem to have been peculiarly vulnerable—perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious and then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads for someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal Newman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge in that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as European politics then had no natural immunity to dictators.

Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any particular truths you'll learn. 
The philosophers whose works they cover would be rolling in their graves at that. 
They hoped they were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped they were getting results. 
Most were wrong, but it doesn't seem an impossible hope.

This argument seems to me like someone in1500 looking at the lack of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process. 
No, they were going about it wrong. 
It turns out it is possible to transmute lead into gold (though not economically at current energy prices), but the route to that knowledge was to backtrack and try another approach.
